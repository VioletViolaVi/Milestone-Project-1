<!-- 1)Overview -->
# My First Project: BusyBakes
<!-- para1 -->
This project is about creating a website for a company that specialises in providing baking classes to people. It is focused on advertising baking lessons to users of the site, who are interested in either learning how to bake or improving on their current baking skills. The website aims to persuade as many users as possible, to sign up with the company and join their baking classes. The name used for the company was BusyBakes. The BusyBakes website consists of four different sections: home, testimonials, schedule and about us. All sections are accessible via the navigation bar at the top of the screen and are placed on a single HTML page. Each section details relevant information required to convince users to join BusyBakes. 
<!-- para2 -->
As the first thing a user sees, the home page informs people upfront that BusyBakes is about teaching individuals how to bake and provides a sign up form, for joining up shortly afterwards. The testimonials page displays photos of people and the baked items they made during their lessons. In addition to their positively expressed opinions on their experience with BusyBakes. The schedule page notifies users on all classes BusyBakes offers as well as their level of difficulty. It also informs them on what day and time these classes are held. Lastly, the about us page provides the user with additional information on BusyBakes’ origins, uniqueness and values. All in an attempt to entice users to join BusyBakes.

# Features
### Existing Features
#### Font Type
Cursive was the font type used for the BusyBakes website. This font was chosen because it is easy for users to read, which is imperative as the user needs to be able to read the guidance on the sign up form to join BusyBakes. This font type also contributes style to the website.
#### Background Image
A single background image was used to cover the whole website. This image consisted of a baking scene with baking equipment spread around. It was selected to be the background in order to help the user quickly understand that the BusyBakes website involved baking.
#### Colours
The colours used in the BusyBakes website were: DarkGoldenRod, GoldenRod and White. Both the DarkGoldenRod and GoldenRod colours were used as the text boxes colours because these colours matched and blended well with the background image.
