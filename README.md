# My First Project: BusyBakes

<!-- para1 -->

This project is about creating a website for a company that specialises in providing baking classes to people. It is focused on advertising baking lessons to users of the site, who are interested in either learning how to bake or improving on their current baking skills. The website aims to persuade as many users as possible, to sign up with the company and join their baking classes. The name used for the company was BusyBakes. The BusyBakes website consists of five different sections: home, testimonials, schedule, about us and sign up. All sections are accessible via the navigation bar at the top of the screen and are placed on a single HTML page. Each section details relevant information required to convince users to join BusyBakes.

<!-- para2 -->

As the first thing a user sees, the homepage informs people upfront that BusyBakes is about teaching people how to bake.The testimonials page displays photos of people and the baked items they made during their lessons. In addition to their positively expressed opinions on their experience with BusyBakes. The schedule page notifies users on all classes BusyBakes offers as well as their level of difficulty. It also informs them on what day and time these classes are held. The about us page provides the user with additional information on BusyBakes’ origins, uniqueness and values. All in an attempt to entice users to join BusyBakes. Lastly, the sign up form at the end enables users to create a membership with BusyBakes so they can start taking classes.

## Wireframe and Website Differences

### Whole website

- A single background image was used for the whole website instead of using multiple in a carousel, as originally intended. This change was made because the change of images caused by the carousel was deemed to be too distracting for the user when trying to read the text placed on it.

### Navigation Bar

- The original idea involving the website changing pages when a different navigation bar link was clicked, was abandoned because clicking links takes more time than scrolling down the webpage. So a single HTML page was used and the navigation bar was changed so that when clicked, the website jumped down to the respective section. Or the user could just scroll up and down the screen.
- The navigation bar was fixed at the top instead of the company name so the user would have an easier time navigating up and down the website.

### Sign Up Page

- Instead of appearing as a modal, the sign up form was placed at the end of all the navigation sections. This was done so the user would be persuaded to sign up whilst scrolling through all that BusyBakes had to offer. Making it more likely for them to join at the end.
- The first name, last name, username, address, confirm email and confirm password inputs of the form were removed to reduce the number of inputs required to fill and maintain the user’s interest. It also ensured only necessary information was being collected from the user.
- A select box was added because it was important to document the level of difficulty the user wanted and what time they wanted to have their classes.

### Testimonials Page

- The testimonial page originally was going to display photos of people and baked foods separately. However, this was changed by grouping together the images of people with the food items to illustrate that the shown food was made by the respective people they were grouped with.
- The sign up button was moved to the bottom of this section to match the rest of the website.

### Schedule Page

- The schedule page had a list of classes added to it so the user could see what lessons were offered if they were to sign up.
- The “morning”, “afternoon” and “evening” headings were removed as they were seen as irrelevant due to the times underneath them. Instead levels of difficulty were introduced i.e. beginner, intermediate and expert to attract a range of different people with different baking abilities.
- The times available were also arranged in columns on laptop and desktop screens, instead of rows.

### About Us Page

- A total of three images were used for the about us page. One image was placed in each paragraph.

### Footer

- The footer was arranged in three rows instead of three columns to make the footer area look more organised. Also, the map was removed as the address was already provided and therefore made it redundant.

# Features

### Existing Features

#### Font Type

Cursive was the font type used for the BusyBakes website. This font was chosen because it is easy for users to read, which is imperative as the user needs to be able to read the guidance on the sign up form to join BusyBakes. This font type also contributes style to the website.

#### Background Image

A single background image was used to cover the whole website. This image consisted of a baking scene with baking equipment spread around. It was selected to be the background in order to help the user quickly understand that the BusyBakes website involved baking.

#### Colours

The main colours used in the BusyBakes website were: DarkGoldenRod, GoldenRod and White. Both the DarkGoldenRod and GoldenRod colours were used for the sign up buttons and the text boxes because these colours matched and blended well with the background image. The text box colours were made transparent to add design to the website. White was used to colour the text of the website so it could be read in the sign up buttons and text boxes they were placed in. Also, a linear gradient with a shade of black and dark blue, was used in front of the background image so the homepage text, without a text box could be read more easily.

#### Navigation Bar

The basic structure of the navigation bar was taken from Bootstrap. The navigation bar is visible throughout the webpage and contains links to all sections of the website. When the user clicks on each link, the website jumps to its respective part of the webpage. On smaller devices the navigation bar appears collapsed and its links hidden, with the bars icon shown at one end and the company name at the other end. The bars icon was taken from Font Awesome. When the bars icon is clicked on, the links are shown as a dropdown menu. On bigger devices such as laptops and desktops, it opens out with all the links viewable at first glance.

#### Home

The homepage includes introductory information about what BusyBakes offers, such as how much lessons cost. It also has a sign up button that when clicked directs the user to the sign up form.

#### Sign Up

The sign up page holds the sign up form. The user enters their details in the inputs. On completion, there is a sign up button underneath to be clicked so their entered data can be sent to BusyBakes for their membership to be created.

#### Testimonials

The testimonials page consists of positive feedback from people who joined BusyBakes to learn how to bake or improve on current baking skills.The page has photos of them as well as the baked items they created. This page provides users with proof that BusyBakes is a good company to learn from. It also has a sign up button that when clicked directs the user to the sign up form.

#### Schedule

The schedule page has details explaining the class’s different levels of difficulty offered by BusyBakes. It shows the variety of lessons taught by them as well as the time and days that they are taught. Enabling the user to decide which lesson they would like to participate in. It also has a sign up button that when clicked directs the user to the sign up form.

#### About Us

The about us page is made up of information on the history of BusyBakes, their values and what makes them unique. It also includes photos of the founder and baking scenarios. This page allows users to learn more about BusyBakes regarding their intention with the service the company provides to prospective customers. It also has a sign up button that when clicked directs the user to the sign up form.

#### Footer

The footer area has details which includes: BusyBakes’ social links, their contact details and copyright information.

1. First, the repository section on GitHub was entered and the project link containing the website and wireframes to be deployed, was clicked on.
2. Then, the settings tab underneath the “Milestone-Project-1” heading, was clicked on to enter its settings.
3. Next, the settings page was then scrolled down until the sub-title “GitHub Pages” was found.
4. Later, under “GitHub Pages” a sub-title called “Source” was located. Under the “Source” sub-title was a button labelled “None”. This “None” button was clicked on to reveal a dropdown menu.
5. In the dropdown menu the option called “master branch” was selected.
6. After selecting the “master branch”, the webpage refreshed automatically and deployed the website.
7. Finally, the link to this newly deployed website, was taken from the “GitHub Pages” section.
